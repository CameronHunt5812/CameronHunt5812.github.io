	<h1>Description</h1>
	<p>
	My program solves a word searches. it uses loops to compair the word search to the words it is looking for
	</p>
	<h2>Reflections</h2>
	I wish that I had more time so I could write code that would replace the words that were found with asterisk. Also a way to look for a word that was the same as the start of another word
	<p>
	You can look at the rest of my code at my <a href="https://github.com/CameronHunt5812/Python_Project">My Github Repository</a>

	This selection of code uses the list placesToCheck to check only in the places inside of the word search. Also when it finds the second letter, it folows the direction, then if it finds the whole word, it prints the chordanits of the first letter, the direction it runs and the word found. I have reworked this code many times as it was hard to think thrue how it would work.

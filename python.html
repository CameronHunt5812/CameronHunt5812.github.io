	<h1>The Word Search Solver</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
	My program solves a word searches. It uses loops to compair each letter in the word search to the firs letter of the word it is looking for. When it finds a match it checks the adjacent letters, if it finds a letter that matches the second letter of the word, it will follow the angle set by those two letters. If it dose not find the word it returns to looking at the ajacent letters and comparing them to words that start with the same letter.
	Befor the program can solve a wordsearch you need to put it into a text file with the width the highth and the number of words in the word search above it, then the word search with no spaces, and after it, each on its own line, the words to look for.
	</p>
	<h2>Reflections</h2>
	I wish that I had more time so I could write code that would replace the words that were found with asterisk. Also a way to look for a word that was the same as the start of another word, like bustop and bus, or a way to find words that start at the same letter.

	<P>
	This selection of code uses the list placesToCheck to check only in the places inside of the word search. Also when it finds the second letter, it folows the direction, then if it finds the whole word, it prints the chordanits of the first letter, the direction it runs and the word found. I have reworked this code many times as it was hard to think thrue how it would work.

	This is the output of the program, printed by the code above, the numbers are the x,y choordanits

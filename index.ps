	<h1>Description</h1>
	<p>
	My program solves a word searches. It uses loops to compair each letter in the word search to the first letter of the word it is looking for. When it finds it, looks at the agacent spots fo the next letter
	to astablish the direction the word is pointing. When it has found the whole word it prints the cordanits of the first letter, the direction the word is pointing and the word at that spot.
	</p>
	<h2>Reflections</h2>
	I wish that I had more time so I could write code that would replace the words that were found with asterisk. Also a way to look for a word that was the same as the start of another word
	<p>
	You can look at the rest of my code at my <a href="https://github.com/CameronHunt5812/Python_Project">My Github Repository</a>

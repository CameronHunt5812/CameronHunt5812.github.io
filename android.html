<h1>Sound to text</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<body>

	<p>My program translates sound into a color by doubling the frequency of a note on the keyboard until its in the range of the visible light spectrum, then finds the RGB ( Red Green Blue) combination closest to it.

	<h2>Some of the code</h2>
	<p>This is used to find the which range of color the sound wave length 
(WL) fits, and then to calculate the value to set the other constituents of the 
collor to. This took a long time to make, at first I tried to find a way to 
calculate all 3 colours from one number, having the values overflowing into the 
next number then draining from the last.

	<h2>Reflections</h2>
	<p>I wish I had found a way to calculate all the RGB values, instead of 
hard coding them in and using if statements to find the closest one. Also I 
wish I had found a way to make the program more stable.

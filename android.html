<h1>Sound to text</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<body>

	<p>My program translates sound into a collor by dubling the frequency of a note on the kye bord until its
	in the range of the visible light spectrum, then finds the RGB ( Rred Green Bloo) combination closest to it.
	<a href=Sound_to_Coller.apk>Dounload the app</a></p>

	<p>I wish i had found a way to calculate the RGB values, insted of hard coading them in.</p>

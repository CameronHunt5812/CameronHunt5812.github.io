<h1>Sound to Colour</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<body>

	<p>My program uses the frequency of the notes on a peano to create a colour. This is a program that takes a note frome the kye bord in the audible range, dubles
	 it until its in the visible light spectrum, and outputs the RGB colour equivalent to that frequency.<a href=Sound_to_Coller.apk>Dounload the app</a>

	<P> I wish that i could have found a way to calculate the RGB colour from the wavelenth insted of using
	many if then else statements to find what colour it was closest to.</p>
